          All published items are approved by the conference committee, and
          original research content is peer-reviewed. The following two peer
          review forms are applied to proceedings journals:
        </p>
        <p className="leading-5">
          1. Coordinated by the conference committee: single- or double-blind
          peer review is decided by the conference organizer; conference chairs
          serve as the academic editors to perform the final assessment.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-5">
          2. Coordinated by an MDPI staff member: single-blind peer review;
          suggestions of reviewers can be made by the academic editor during the
          precheck. Alternatively, MDPI editorial staff will use qualified
          Advisory Board Members, qualified reviewers from our database, or new
          reviewers identified by web searches for related articles, and the
          journalâ€™s Advisory Board Members serve as the academic editors to make
          the final decision.
