      'Carvone, a natural monoterpene, has been identified in various plants, giving them a characteristic scent. Enantiomers (R-(–) and S-(+)) reveal specific biological activities that are successfully used in traditional medicine for their antifungal, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and anti-influenza properties.',
    readMore:
      'paper is based on S-(+)-carvone, characterized by a specific caraway scent, which revealed rich biological activities both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate the potential anti-neurodegenerative activity of S-(+)-carvone, including in vitro experiments (butyrylcholinesterase inhibitory, neuro- and hepatotoxicity as well as neuro- and hepatoprotective activity), in vivo (memory acquisition, locomotor activity), and ex vivo (determination of S-(+)-carvone’s level in tissues collected from mice). Results revealed the multidirectional character of S-(+)-carvone. It has been shown that S-(+)-carvone is capable of butyrylcholinesterase inhibition (40% for 0.025 mg applied onto the plate), and neuroprotection and hepatoprotection at selective concentrations against reactive oxygen species generation and lipid peroxidation along with non-hepatotoxicity character. Additionally, multiple-dose administration of the monoterpene at a dose of 100 mg/kg had a positive influence on memory acquisition. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of the plasma and the brain showed that S-(+)-carvone can cross the blood–brain barrier and accumulate in the hippocampus (0.217 µg/mg of tissue), a crucial part of the brain associated with cognition and mental functions',

      'The review analyzes data from over 20 clinical trials and epidemiological studies on the role of omega-3 fatty acids in neuroinflammation. It highlights their interaction with key pathways such as the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the promotion of neuroprotective mechanisms, making them a potential candidate for therapeutic use in diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Findings suggest a strong link between omega-3 intake and improved cognitive health, with a reduction in markers of brain inflammation.',
