              MDPI is an academic open access publisher based in Basel,
              Switzerland, and was initially founded in 1996 to collect and
              preserve rare chemical research samples. To support the samples
              project, MDPI started the journal Molecules the same year. Since
              1996, MDPI has grown into a publishing house with over 390
              journals and with offices in Beijing and Wuhan (China), Barcelona
              (Spain), Belgrade (Serbia), Cluj (Romania), Manchester (UK), Tokyo
              (Japan), Craców (Poland), Toronto (Canada) and Singapore. MDPI is
              backed by more than 295,000 academic experts who support our
              mission, values, and commitment to providing high-quality service
              for our authors.

              Open Access mean that readers can access published material for
              free, without paying a subscription charge. MDPI articles are
              freely available immediately after publication. This means that
              researchers, students, and interested lay people from anywhere in
              the world have rapid access to the latest research through MDPI
              journals. All MDPI content is distributed under a Creative Commons
              open access license.
            </p>
            <p>
              We finance publication through article processing charges (APC),
              paid by authors and their institutions. APCs cover the cost of
              managing the peer review process, professional copy-editing, and
              promotion of published research MDPI has no other source of
              income.
            </p>
            <p>
              For authors, open access means a potentially wider circle of
              readers for their research papers, with some research suggesting
              that open access papers are more highly cited.
            </p>
            <p>
              At MDPI, we believe that open access offers value for money for
              researchers—our income per article is substantially lower than
              established subscription publishers. We offer a good deal for
              funding bodies—outcomes can be widely circulated and no barrier
              for reading offers transparency to those footing the bill. We also
              offer transparency to tax payers, who indirectly fund a great deal
              of research—through open access they have the opportunity to see
              the results of their contributions.
