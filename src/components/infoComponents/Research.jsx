          All submitted manuscripts must conform to MDPIâ€™s policies as
          described. In all instances, MDPI closely follows the Committee on
          Publication Ethics (COPE) principles of publication ethics laid out in
          its core practices documents. Their advice includes support on
          handling issues such as: conflicts of interest, authorship and
          contributorship issues and disputes, misconduct allegations and data
          issues, overlap and plagiarism, and peer review integrity.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xs leading-5">
          MDPI Editorial Boards are independent, and the publisher will not
          interfere with editorial decision making. Where ethical or legal
          concerns are present, a decision may be changed; acceptance of a
          manuscript may be rescinded should an ethical issue or conflict with
          policies be identified. Manuscripts that do not conform to MDPI
          ethical policies may be withdrawn from submission by the publisher.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xs leading-5">
          MDPI performs checks on all manuscripts to confirm that they conform
          with the Publication Ethics Guidelines. Some of the checks described
          are performed with the support of automatic checks, facilitated by
          SuSy, while others are performed manually by the Journal Editorial
          Office teams. Where potential issues are flagged, these are confirmed
          by a human decision maker. Where a manuscript does not conform to
          policies or is flagged upon check, in many cases, an Academic Editor
          is consulted.
